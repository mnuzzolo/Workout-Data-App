# Workout-Data-App

This app displays the user's data for a series of workouts, sorted by Exercise. User can view Exercise details and see a list of past workouts as well as progress data. Progress data is determined by looking at the difference in maximum weight and number of reps between the most recent workout and the oldest workout recorded. Unit tests have been added to verify functionality of important helper classes and ViewModels.

Key functionality:
- Paging of data
- Sorting
- Mocked loading behavior & progress indicator
- Navigation Stack
- MVVM
- async/await 
- Unit Tests using XCTest
- Separation of Concerns
